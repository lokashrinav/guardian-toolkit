# 🧪 Complete Testing Guide - Week 3-4 System

This guide shows you **exactly** how to test and use each component of the AI Completions & Rewrite system.

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1. Test the Foundation (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start the Baseline API server
cd baseline-hackathon
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000

# In another terminal, test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/isSafe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"feature": "fetch"}'

# Expected response:
# {"query":"fetch","found":true,"safety":"safe","baseline":"high"...}
```

### 2. Test Feature Detection

```bash
# Run the integration test
node test-integration.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ fetch: safe (Baseline: high)
# ✅ grid: safe (Baseline: high) 
# ⚠️ subgrid: caution (Baseline: low)
```

### 3. Test How It All Works Together

```bash
# Run the complete demonstration
node test-how-it-works.js

# Shows exactly what each component does with real examples
```

## 📦 Component-by-Component Testing

### VS Code Extension Testing

**What it does:** Real-time warnings in VS Code as you type

**How to test without VS Code:**
```bash
# The extension files are ready at:
ls vscode-extension/src/
# extension.ts - Main extension logic
# completionGuard.ts - AI completion filtering  
# baselineChecker.ts - API integration
# codeRewriter.ts - Auto-rewrite suggestions

# To install in VS Code (if you have it):
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile
# Then load as development extension
```

**What you'd see in VS Code:**
- Red squiggles under unsafe features like `replaceAll()`
- Hover tooltips: "String.replaceAll() has limited support"
- Right-click menu: "Rewrite Unsafe Features"
- Auto-complete filters out unsafe suggestions

### Codemod Tool Testing

**What it does:** Batch transforms unsafe code across entire projects

**How to test:**
```bash
cd codemod
npm install

# Create test file with unsafe code
echo 'const result = text.replaceAll("old", "new");' > test-unsafe.js

# Analyze the file
npx ts-node src/index.ts analyze "test-unsafe.js"

# Transform the file (dry run)
npx ts-node src/index.ts transform "test-unsafe.js" --dry-run

# Expected output:
# ✅ test-unsafe.js: 1 transformation
#   → string-replaceall: Replaced replaceAll with global regex
```

### PR Review Bot Testing

**What it does:** AI-powered GitHub PR reviews with educational comments

**How to test without GitHub:**
```bash
cd pr-review-bot
npm install

# Set environment variables for testing
export BASELINE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="test-key-for-demo"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="test-token"

# Start the bot server
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001

# Test manual review trigger
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/review/owner/repo/123"

# Expected response:
# {"success": true, "message": "Review completed"}
```

**What it would do on GitHub:**
- Automatically comment on PRs with unsafe features
- Generate educational explanations using GPT-4
- Provide specific code fix suggestions
- Approve PRs that are Baseline-safe

## 🔍 Real-World Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Modern JavaScript Developer

**Create test file:**
```javascript
// test-modern.js
async function loadUsers() {
  const response = await fetch("/api/users");
  const users = await response.json();
  
  return users.map(user => ({
    ...user,
    slug: user.name.replaceAll(" ", "-").toLowerCase()
  }));
}
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
# 1. Check individual features
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/isSafe -d '{"feature":"fetch"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/isSafe -d '{"feature":"string-replaceall"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# 2. Analyze file
node test-integration.js  # Will detect both features

# 3. Get transformation suggestions
# The system would suggest:
# - fetch: Add availability check
# - replaceAll: Use global regex
```

### Scenario 2: CSS Developer

**Create test file:**
```css
/* test-modern.css */
.container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}

.parent:has(.child.active) {
  background: yellow;
}
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
# Check CSS features
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/isSafe -d '{"feature":"container-queries"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/isSafe -d '{"feature":"has-selector"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/isSafe -d '{"feature":"grid"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Results:
# container-queries: ✅ safe (Baseline: high)  
# has-selector: ❓ not found (would be caution if found)
# grid: ✅ safe (Baseline: high)
```

## 🎯 Expected Test Results

### ✅ What Should Work

1. **Foundation API** responds with proper Baseline data
2. **Feature detection** identifies modern web features in code
3. **Safety classification** correctly categorizes features (safe/caution/unsafe)
4. **Transformation suggestions** provide safer alternatives
5. **Integration flow** works from detection → analysis → suggestions

### ⚠️ Limitations in Test Environment

These would work in production but need full setup:
- **VS Code Extension**: Requires VS Code and extension installation
- **GitHub Integration**: Needs GitHub webhooks and tokens
- **OpenAI Integration**: Requires OpenAI API key for AI comments
- **Full Codemod**: Needs TypeScript compilation for complex transformations

### 🔧 Mock vs Real Testing

**What we can test now (Mock):**
- Core API functionality ✅
- Feature detection logic ✅
- Safety classifications ✅
- Transformation patterns ✅
- Integration workflows ✅

**What needs real environment:**
- VS Code UI interactions
- GitHub webhook events
- AI-generated review comments
- TypeScript AST transformations

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Testing confirms:**
- ✅ 15+ web features detected and classified
- ✅ Real Baseline data from web-features package
- ✅ Proper safety recommendations
- ✅ Code transformation suggestions
- ✅ Complete integration workflow

**Developer experience:**
- ✅ Immediate feedback on unsafe features
- ✅ Educational explanations with context
- ✅ Automated fixes for common issues
- ✅ Seamless workflow from IDE to PR review

## 🚀 Next Steps

After testing, you can:

1. **Install VS Code extension** (if you use VS Code)
2. **Set up GitHub bot** for your repositories
3. **Use codemod tool** on real projects
4. **Extend with custom rules** for your specific needs

The system is designed to work together - each component enhances the others to create a complete Baseline safety net for web development.
